- ⚡ Fun fact:  I can do a head stand 🧘‍♀️😉
-  ℹ️  More about myself: I am a Data Science student with a background in business and HR. My goal is to integrate analytics and data science with business,
     particularly focusing on the people side of the business. I believe that understanding your workforce is just as crucial as understanding your customers. Nothing drives business performance better than a culture of engaged employees.
- 💡Some of the thought leaders I follow and their views on analytics and people in organizations:
   -  💭Keith McNulty:
“Organizations that leverage people analytics and foster high levels of employee engagement see a direct correlation with superior business results. Engagement drives productivity, and productivity drives performance.”

   -  💭David Ulrich:
“The key to effective HR is to focus on the impact you have on the business. By using people analytics to measure and manage employee performance and engagement, HR can drive significant business outcomes.”

   - 💭Josh Bersin:
“People analytics has moved from being a ‘nice to have’ to a critical tool for understanding and managing talent. Companies that use people analytics are more likely to make better decisions, improve employee engagement, and drive business performance.”

   - 💭Brett Minchington:
“The ability to attract, engage, and retain top talent is the single most important competitive advantage in today’s economy. People analytics provides the insights needed to enhance employee engagement and drive organizational success.”
